# Power-BI-Hotel-Data-Analysis
Here I developed a data analysis project using hotel booking data I sourced from a database I created by uploading Excel data sheets. The database was connected to Power BI to answer some business questions and have a visual product at the end.
Stakeholder's questions that need to be answered:
" Is our hotel revenue growing over the years? "
We have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type.
" Should we increase our parking lot size? "
We have to understand if there is a trend for guests with personal cars.
" What trends can we see in the data? "
Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality.
